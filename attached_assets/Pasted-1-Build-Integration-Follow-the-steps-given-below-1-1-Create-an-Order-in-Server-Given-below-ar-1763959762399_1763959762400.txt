1. Build Integration
Follow the steps given below:

1.1 Create an Order in Server
Given below are the order states and the corresponding payment states:

Payment Stages	Order State	Payment State	Description
Stage I	created	created	The customer submits the payment information, which is sent to Razorpay . The payment is not processed at this stage.
Stage II	attempted	authorized/failed	An order moves from created to attempted state when payment is first attempted. It remains in this state until a payment associated with the order is captured.
Stage III	paid	captured	After the payment moves to the captured state, the order moves to the paid state.
No more payment requests are allowed after an order moves to the paid state.
The order continues to be in this state even if the payment for this order is refunded.
Capture Payments Automatically

You can capture payments automatically with the one-time Payment Capture setting configuration on the Dashboard.

Order is an important step in the payment process.

An order should be created for every payment.
You can create an order using the Orders API. It is a server-side API call. Know how to authenticate Orders API.
The order_id received in the response should be passed to the checkout. This ties the order with the payment and secures the request from being tampered.
Watch Out!

Payments made without an order_id cannot be captured and will be automatically refunded. You must create an order before initiating payments to ensure proper payment processing.

You can create an order using:

2. Test Integration
After the integration is complete, a Pay button appears on your webpage/app.

Test integration on your webpage/app
Click the button and make a test transaction to ensure the integration is working as expected. You can start accepting actual payments from your customers once the test transaction is successful.

You can make test payments using one of the payment methods configured at the Checkout.

Watch Out!

This is a mock payment page that uses your test API keys, test card and payment details.

Ensure you have entered only your Test Mode API keys in the Checkout code.
Test mode may include OTP verification for certain payment methods to replicate the live payment experience.
No real money is deducted due to the usage of test API keys. This is a simulated transaction.
